# Pong.nes

I wrote Pong for the NES on stream!

## Building
### Requirements

See this guide to setup the build environtment: [NES_Build_Environment.md](https://gist.github.com/zorchenhimer/b5e1f30feb082f5a920c6b7e7a072b13)

### How Do

```
$ git clone https://github.com/zorchenhimer/nes-pong.git
$ cd nes-pong
$ make
```

After running `make` you'll have a `bin/` folder that has a bunch of files including the rom, symbols files, and object file.

## What?

### How do I get to the credits screen?

Hold down `A` and `B` then press `Start` on the title screen.

### Why is there a credits screen?

I wanted to have something to say "Thank You" to the viewers that supported me while working on this project on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/zorchenhimer).
